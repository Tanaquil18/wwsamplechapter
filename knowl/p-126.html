<div class="para">Not all problems that come from the OPL are compatible with PreTeXt. The reasons vary. Perhaps the problem uses older WeBWorK macros that cannot be augmented to provide PreTeXt output. Perhaps the problem nests a table within a table, which PreTeXt will not support. Perhaps there are graphics in the problem that are not sized appropriately for PreTeXt output and thereâ€™s nothing you can do about it. And there are many more reasons.</div>
