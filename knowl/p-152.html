<div class="para">Sometimes you would like a student to give a “simple” answer that WeBWorK can automatically assess, but you would also like the student to show their work or reasoning.

For practical reasons, you may wish to use the same problem on your WeBWorK server, but omit the essay part. For example, if you want to use that problem but leave out the manual grading.
