# Converted the WeBWorK Sample Chapter to use the CLI and Codespaces

Maybe I did figure out the Runestone target... 

I followed the instructions here: Subsection 5.2.7: The project manifest: project.ptx 
https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/processing-CLI.html#cli-project-manifest

and I didn't follow the instructions here: Section 32.2: Publishing to Runestone Academy 
https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/sec-publishing-to-runestone-academy.html#sec-publishing-to-runestone-academy

I still don't know why one of my additional problems in the ac-in-runestone-testing section isn't working, so that's commented out for now.
