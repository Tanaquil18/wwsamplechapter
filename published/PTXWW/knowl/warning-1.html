</h3> <div class="para">Not all problems that come from the OPL are compatible with PreTeXt. The reasons vary. Perhaps the problem uses older WeBWorK macros that cannot be augmented to provide PreTeXt output. Perhaps the problem nests a table within a table, which PreTeXt will not support. Perhaps there are graphics in the problem that are not sized appropriately for PreTeXt output and thereâ€™s nothing you can do about it. And there are many more reasons.</div> <div class="para">Unfortunately the variety of reasons for which a problem may be incompatible means that at present, there is no way to validate a problem automatically. Using an incompatible problem might not raise any errors at any stage of the PreTeXt processing, but large chunks of the problem may be missing, especially in print output. So we recommend that you review all output modes when using an OPL problem. Chances are that if it is behaving in print, it will behave elsewhere. But that is an unproven theory at this point.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-open-problem-library.html#warning-1" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
